Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
killings in a weekend killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say

On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
What if Mary What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God

Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool 
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever Who has it
You blowin up thats good fantastic

But Im looking for the one have you seen her
My psychic told me shell have a ass like Serena
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz
Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of yall say I still love her
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime
When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us

Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeyes is finished girl
You dont love me you just pretendin

Chicago St Louis St Louis to Chicago

Only thing open is Waffle House girl dont start with me

But you were suckin a nigga dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjobs better than no job

On my bodyguards back like Prince in the club
She say Can you get my friends in the club
I say Can you get my Benz in the club
If not treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside til the evenin end
When I go raw I like to leave it in
When I wake up I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She cant go to work same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again
I drink a Boost for breakfast an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr HtotheIzzos back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal shed been trying to be mine
She a Delta so shed been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin I been tryin to be signed
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint trying to make a band
I swear this right here history in the making man
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
But he wasnt talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except hes really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I aint too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God Driver wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe safe
My dawgs couldnt tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised
Theres been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable what you thought theyd call me Mr Glass
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up Im a grownass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But Im a champion so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music thats fire spit my soul through the wire
Lets get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary Im the boss tonight
And you dont give a fuck what they all say right
Awesome the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn they dont make em like this anymore

Do anybody make real shit anymore
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go apeshit
Specially in my Pastel on my Bape shit
Act like you cant tell who made this
New Gospel homie take six and take this haters

But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo sponsored by Manolo

Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
She dont believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like love to start shit
Im more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like Where are you Yeezy
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown
It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov
This a new crack on a new stove

Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch huh
And if lifes a bitch bet she suck my dick huh

By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga
Just forget it you talk it I live it

Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga
Going H¬¨‚àëA¬¨‚àëM nigga

But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H¬¨‚àëA¬¨‚àëM
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes

Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission

Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation

Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go

From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed now you doing your thang
Good morning look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world complacent career student

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
Whipped it out she said I never seen Snakes on a Plane
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dawg in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dawg You where I am
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
And Ill never let his mom move to LA
Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
Its kinda crazy thats all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Well have a bigass crib and a long yard
Well have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
Imma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her Get away 
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on
Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
Ease up there baby boy Ving Rhames told Jody that
R Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
All∆í√Öhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up
We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pi‚àö¬±a coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say How is work baby
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor Just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
How could you be so Dr Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me
You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize

In the movie I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize

She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance

The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonc‚àö¬©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the Nigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over caskets
Man killings some wack shit

Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say

See me at the airport at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay groupies say Im too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays I still have it my way
Yall dont want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
Ill show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
Damn Ye itd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is superofficial
RRRRoc pastel with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on

Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on Ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said You going to school Ill give you a summer
Then she met No ID and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And Im rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess Im getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folksll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes damn
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This aint no fashion show mothafucka we live it
Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right aight
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means
And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
Seven oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if youll ever find your dreams
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smokin sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing beats a day for summers
Thats a Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship
Nnnnow my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I cant call it I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said Ise a loser I told her why dont you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me Im gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You aint gotta guess whos back you see
Im so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastards flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I dont usually smoke
But pass the dro
And I wont give you that money that you asking for

Cause this summer they aint finna say next summer Im finna
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin man your ass is grown
The second verse is for my dogs workin to that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off
And everybody sellin makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
He figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And we dont care what people say
You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school

Im tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here

When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say

And this is for the family that cant be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us

And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it

Fit in the bed if its of yall
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin

I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestys swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
Can I talk my shit again
Even if I dont hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding
My hat my shoes my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace
Thats Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy I drank Im gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona Im zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And Hey
Please dont start me
Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
Im on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Its easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy
I did it for the glory
What am I supposed to do now
Man the game all messed up
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends
Yeah the dark skined ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please dont judge me uh for the followin
Fat bitches swallowin skinny bitches modelin
Take off that Givenchy and lets get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing cause when you chase the pussy its a sin
But if it falls in your lap its a blessin
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers
My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie
I do it for the forefathers yeah the street authors
That are now ARs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wont make it to the family will
If I dont make it cant take it hope the family will
They aint crazy they dont know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so its not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
You know the demo your boy act wild

So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelrys Egyptian know the hungers Ethiopian
Stupid questions like Is he gon be dope again
Have you seen him has anybody spoke to him 
This beat deserves Hennessey a bad bitch
And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your lifes cursed well mines an obscenity

Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head stop breathe get up check your weave
Dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and dont disrespect your seed

And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me

You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be

And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
My friend showed me pictures of his kids

He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car oh

Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone

And Im feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They dont want black people to think and drive
I mean my whole team bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that its Fashion Week
And the weather wasnt barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott
Did I mention GOOD Music and forever we hot
Motherfucker are you ready or not
Merry Christmas to all and all a good night
Huh now we all livin the good life
Yeah though its forty below the wind chill
And we wipin snow up off the windshield
Its still wonderful night to be alive baby
And Im so happy Im with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin for the mall dont trip you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that You the star at the top of my Christmas tree 
My only question is Where my presents 
She said Shhh she got a gift for me that aint for the kids to see
Well I like the way you think mami

And your girlfriend she kinda raw
But she not like you

Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep Im tired of yall
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
See you know my style
Im very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said daddy thats the reason why you had me
Yep we was praticing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cuz now yall
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause its flooded
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
My teeth already white yall gon make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds whats the cause of the fronting
Why yall got all caps on
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Burn Hollywood burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear lifes a bitch on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I dont give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks
Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
Yall forget that I got called nigga
On Twitter so many times yo I lived that
Now Im just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Dont give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away huh Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches I cant take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
Im an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didnt have the ends
I wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
Im spaced out Dogg I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we aint finna change so well never agree again
Till then Ill be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
Im spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say Ive been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
Ill be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like IceT
Im not right dog Im slightly off
Im paranoid like bonin raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea thatll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you I shouldve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end Imma let Mos begin
You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Whats the cause of the poor smell
She said I just cleaned up
Baby I cant tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score he took the charge
Oooh that shit gotta hurt
Its the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet Im going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
For the team
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why He at least HooperSize
You know I scrutinize like Who this newer guy
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasnt
Tryna get to know me homie Just kill the charm
You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out I aint going to sleep no time soon
And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
Now that Im grown the tables turned around
I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama there
Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
He be wilding out be calm
I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
You gonna marry my mom Look I dont read palms
And I dont read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look little man kids dont make the rules
Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasnt bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Told her this rap game is alright Im just getting by
She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
Told me back in she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo back in I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
Was it something I did wrong
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and Im at work yo
And she dont call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Tryin to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
No Im trying to callone ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Imma take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said I know what you about to say like your hypeman
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but
Roll some think Ill roll some
To know some if we both honest
Who lasts yeah you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know whats mine when I see it
I know I know I know when I see it
Riding down the baby
Pacing thinking to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Dont know why but I know a sign when I see it
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
I think its time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny and I know its especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half woman laughing
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so s
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the inch rim wheels looks so good with your inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system
Cause you in my soul and system
And we gon take her home with this one
I got something that you gon like
You got something that I cant fight
We got something that we both gon like
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
Its been a whole lot of hatin again
And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews Im representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown
Get you a cute chick face got potential
Working with her little hips waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you but you know how Ye do
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain says is that HeSus
If Im unfaithful blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them Ds
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad tell by the Chloe bag
She aint no hoodrat she aint gotta prove that
I peep the McCartneys Stella got her groove back
Hold on lemme ask you why you spend your money on that shallow shit
Why dont you buy some bigger tits

So the respect is due like my Louie back

Sara Lee with the dough Im talkin bout the cake maid

And when The Workout Plan aint work out man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived he died
For his image now lets start the scrimmage
In the first quarter I sacked MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my lifes breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensationll shine through your mind
Take it line for line
Look I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around you dont speak to me
When my girl be around I see you peepin me
When they both aint around you be freakin me
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin on cause my story keep changin up
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
Truthfully if you tellin people that you doin me
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more
You wanna stay but you cant stay no more
You wanna be with K but that aint okay no more
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check they aint never where theyre supposed to be

You coulda been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
Thats good for my ego

And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt

Certain things I cant doctor and you say Im the worst
I aint have enough patients but I needed a nurse
Thatll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR

With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches

Whats the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I dont rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jacksons
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind
Ahh The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask em how do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But its quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again
Yeah history in the makin Do or Die
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
Thats how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks I done got Cnotes
So glad I aint take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
Fuckin with my girl today around threeoh
My man said lets call some girls that we know
Ohhhhhhhh
Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me now feel so sick just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked drink and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it cant be enough
Ever since I been flossin
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They dont breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold Steve Austin
Claim that I boss em
Basically Diana Ross em
But whos to blame for all these fights
When you aint always wrong
Im just always right
And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right
When I pack my bags
When I got that cab
You never thought Kanye would ever got that mad
You acting like I aint the reason that you got that Jag
That you got that bag
Lets talk about amnesia
Yeah you got that bad
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
And Im the best version of Mase next to Fab
And Imma call your best friend up just to stab
Cause of the way that you do
Mae said cmon Mike said chamone
Started up early like RavenSymon‚àö¬©
Keisha KnightPull Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin handed to dude but did I complain
Every time magazines try to taint my name
But yall cant hold me down like restraint
I took the T off out the word cant
round same time when Nas said I can
Bush for sendin our fam to Iran
Im in the club with a henny ass in my other hand
Lord please forgive me Im just a man
Right now Im trying to make some adjustments
Before they do me like they did Janet and Just and em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I aint eva eva accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm yea that something to ponder
The money I make on this ones for Donda
Thats West to you you the next
I cant hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Man how did she bring it up How did she break it down
Man you at the clinic Dog slow down thats your child
But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there its hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her Man dont say that
Matter fact like Pat dont say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back
I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say Im sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home he from the street
He gon want him some strippers
And Im a big tipper I dont need to be trippin
This my first Rolex it dont even be tickin
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean Im into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured
Yeah Kanye to the yeah
Im with this bad Ethiopian chick drinkin straight up liquor
I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Uggs
Have girls feet lookin like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with a name some rhyme nameless
Dont try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology
Cause Im Im tryin to make it to Uranus
See thats a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin to figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James
They say whoa dont get caught up in the hype
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch aww
Know everything but dont know shit aww
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
I just turn my music up like Damn thats some cold shit aww
I mighta known her bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
He said You lying yo why is you lying yo
Cut it out quit it G you hurting my kidineys
Naw she talking bout a couple of kids for me aww
Shes hinting at a ring from Tiffanys
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
Theres only one girl on my agenda
You talking bout Brenda
Naw Im talking bout Linda from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like Mase but she love Face
And I know that Linda was a hiphophead
And I know that Linda gave HipHop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
Got em but she know a rreeal nigga when she spot him
So now shes pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and heres my name
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin Cheers to you for your future years of pain
Like Dog you ready to give all this shit up
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
And when they see the way the G lights lit up
Youre gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But naww I bought her a brand new BM
He said Dog slow down like Brand Nubian now
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid
I got em chillin in the cooler
Break out the ruler
Damn
Them the biggest tits I ever seen
We smokin killer Cali gettin weeded
Make it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many BIs so much inspiration
Hey miss
Whos there
No time to do hair
Im through here
The show tonight
So get right
You look aight
Lets club now
A rub down
Starts flavor while we grind in the theater
Im tryin to cut in the movies
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look
Dont change the facts about these plaques
Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch

From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghosts style mixed with Mos style
Im versatile Im the poster child
Getting cheese so Im suppose to smile get it
We making hits like Sosa now hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well
Well our father please forgive me
Im sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks charge around Cnotes
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
I broke up with my girl today around
My man said Lets call some girls that we know
Sometimes I wanna say Fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoked drank and yeah we fucked
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
Now this weed drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me thats an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin
Girl told you dont leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon leave your ass
But when he get low he gon need your ass
If he cryin callin bawlin

Yeah we be makin up but when we makin up
All were makin up is the truth
Damn I know she love me oh
But Im in the Matrix and Im feelin Im Neo
She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
Or write a four page letter like Aaliyah
But Im a Gemini thats bossy like a Leo
And sometimes I dont know what side Im on
I just know this Patr‚àö‚â•n got me gone
And Ive done fucked up so bad that I cant go home
Kanye the best in the game now we got that that thing clear
Kanye West is the name Southside up in here

Good morning to ChiTown where my niggas ride down
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down

But her gear is bangin she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise she said I aint bonin you
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said Ye you dont love me
I told her it was good its too bad it got ugly
Listen yo

Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim its stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I cant restrain they real
I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please dont mess up the trick
Hey Young World Im the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we cant let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone thats only average
For advice OMG you listen to that bitch
Woe is me baby this is tragic
Cause we had it we was magic
I was flying now Im crashing
This is Bad real bad Michael Jackson

Make a young nigga straight need Viagra
Make a old nigga give keys to Jaguar
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter
Her telling her homegirls that he couldnt stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said I would if hell handle biz up in the sheets
Pop off like a thang thang
He keep keep
And every time that she bang bang
He skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you Cassie and Kim Kardashian
Maybe thatll work when you get to hit that ass again
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Now yall can have sexy time its nice

Plus the waist and times awastin

I feel like its still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas dont know hes stressed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best

Cause when the Jesus pieces cant bring me peace
Yo I need just at least uh one of Russells nieces

God sent me a message said Im too aggressive

You say you wrong you wrong Im right Im right
Youre wrong we fight
Ok Im running from the light running from the day to night
Oh the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try its too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Let it fall let it crash burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh you call upon God
We keep these Gs in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So Imma be at least about a hour late

How could you love someone that hurt you played you spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of

Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth

If this real niXga business then you niXgas unemployed
Jumped on the celly called Machiavelli

And when life sucks I just enjoy the head
Im so sick of these niXgas I need meds
Smoking on a hallelujah thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R Im a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass and everybodys looking
But how can you get the picture if you dont know who took it
This current affairs but who the hell cares
Everybodys fighting over positions musical chairs
On the road to redemption go on and use a few stairs
Im just fucking ready so I come prepared yeah
I know your name yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion damn
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air

VerseLittle Brother
How many ways can I say Im done fishin

Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food foreign cars many women
And some say its the life I was given
I say it dont matter if I work at McEDs
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees
On a new broad you still one to one
Every once in again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but whats done is done
Women steppin out for love men do what to come
Not a playa like Pun but when shorties get the grabbin on me
The last thought I get is Koobie run
To them girls wishin on a star thats will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is hun one

And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating
But I aint never had to wear no black eye from beatings
As long as he doing right by you and your kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is
I aint sayin that its right but we often pay the price
Cause a womens life is love a mans love is life
And he gon live it to the fullest and I aint tryna pull you down or sound

But you should know by now that all niXgas is dogs
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard
Chorus x
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know

Like Shadai we got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep like your first tattoo
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I dont want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey girl dont play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
You gotta hold ya soldier down
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner
And you dont want to leave me believe me
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv
Its young weezy I know what ya thought
But Im just here to play my part so dont go breakin my heart
Chorus x Lil Wayne First Lil Brother Second

Tell them niXgas no love lost cause I aint got shit to lose

But I graduated from that bullshit now I hate school
Outro

And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

Hearing through the grapevine niXgas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime

Straight frowns no daps strapped three times

Tell them pussy niXgas come together

Six feet under flowers you aint nothing but a petal niXga

Thirty years old shit thatll be a giving niXga
Quit it Wayne your Mom is listening
But she aint really trippin cause the pots is pissed in
Them niXgas tripping until the shots whistling
Hear them bullets sizzle like a cobra at attention
I gotta bitch and quit calling women bitches
As long as she dont worry bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind I gotta get it
Im admitted to the game true playa no quitting
There you go shitting on a way a niXga thanking
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
This is the future aint promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Train in the tidal wave this is the ocean
Stand in the heat til the mother fucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope let them tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless rats and roaches
Running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune
Come and get it automatics in motion
We banging for the bread niXga even the molded

Chaperon of the south I got my coast yea
And until I die Im the the the the the best rapper alive

And I dont even know which crowd Im on
Dont look down but the ground is gone
Dont look down cause the ground is gone
Right now Im a million miles from home
And Im so high that the ground is gone
I know a girl named Crystal her last name Ball
I look into her eyes and I can see it all
I see it when she cry Im there when she call
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill em all die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin would a mind be in spiritual for
Huh shit cause aint no love

It aint no hurricane it aint no flood
This some other shit we aint no of
Make that money yeah make that money
Then watch the goverment take that money
But we gon raise hell motherfucker get well
Laws get passed and economies fail
Love hate emotion compulsion addiction fictionvirgins
Dixons means mixing swinging switching swagging
Sweets freaks faggots flame fashion planes crashing

Dawg you gotta feel me on this one

Look who I be around niXga look who I been around niXga
Geezy Juve and Turk be and Slim dawg pay attention dawg
Verse
Age is nothin but some digits niXga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every ripcas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night shell flip
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when Im pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin Im Tyson and shit
But Im a man so Im here to handle my situtions correctly
And i noI might be dumb but niXgas gone definantly respect me
But in the mean partner Im fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like im livin happy now
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke aboutblunts
and puff a cooler bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
just so I get through the stuff but I be like
Chorus x
Ahhhh man its complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man
Im gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN
Verse
I try to keep my head up but I die to keep my bread up
And usually Im fed up thinkin everythangs a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And i get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff trust me its tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
And Im walkin on the edge stuck without a solution
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
And I dont need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it
Cas yall cats dont really no me yall jus no bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest
And I aint neva said they dont appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasnt a man I wouldnt make it through
Chorus x
Verse
Who would have known that this was somthin that didnt turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
Im influenced and effected by the way it became
And I dont play with them at all so I dont say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
Im always street so Ill forever be facin a change
And Ill keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then Im waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And Im so often Im congratulated for the succeced at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didnt ask for you to like me I dont care if you hate me
But dont mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell Im gone
And I dawg I do believe Im grown
so Ill be good on my own but I be like
Chorus fadingBelieve Dat

We got to it and we didnt stop till the birds hit the block
And she aint neva had it like that
Chorus
Girl you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here girl tonight
So I can get my grown man on with you
You dont kno about it Im on my grown man x

But tonight Ill make an exception
For some reason I cant seem to keep my eyes out your direction
Im lookin at you so hard I could probably catch a charge
Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn
I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier
Young man young money with the money long
Currency tha hot spitta it so grown
And ur perception of me is so wrong
Dont worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved
And you dont rock like them I can see it in your eyes
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise
cause tonight you lookin like ms right
And I swore to be a player for life but Ill change for you
Chorus

Hey
I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
Were apart and away
And it feels so stray
Nge wouldnt you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could
Do it again x
Hey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
Do it again
Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But imma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then Ill be there to catch you
Yes
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didnt do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
Do it again x
Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And Im just wishin
We could
Do it again x

And Im in it like Bennett hoe arent I cool
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move
Then the attitude switch and the heatll move

Im takin these chances my head to the sky my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge if the money dont move
Then I wont budge wont budge no I wont budge no na
Money is the motivation

Hop in that thang and merk off swerve off
You know me they call me Birdman Junior
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it

I take it for what it is worth to the turf motherfucker yea
Chorus
I aint never killed nobody I promise I promise if you try me
He gone have to rewind this track and make me go back
That thing will go blat that boy will lay flat so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got Nina in my palm and Im masturbatin
Black Peter Pan flies til I die what you sayin
Bathing Ape Yves Saint Evisu what I stay in
Got me feelin like Scarface like the Koheba

You know I be out here ridin a four seater
Top floor of the four seasons four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up and look I got some

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh

Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it, ooh,

I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile

Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect

To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh baby

Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours

I will feel the power
But you won't

Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you

Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

We will stand tall
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl

Ooh....... New York x2 Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy-cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! One hand in the air for the big city,
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York! She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Oh, oh, oh,
She's just a girl, and she's on fire I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling

Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes

That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights

Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams

Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now) You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh, baby

The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you

The way that I love you What? Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time, you were telling me lies So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Have you ever try sleeping with a broken heart?
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you You wore the crown, you made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me, need me
I thought you told me, you'd never leave me Looking in the sky I could see your face
Then I knew right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you
Right till the end So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Some people live for the fortune

For the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow
State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulders
Gotta find the strength in me I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters
Coming together
Say yes I will
Yes I can I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman When I'm breaking down
And I can't be found
And I start to get weak
Cause no one knows
Me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly, ooh I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes

Really, really wanted to catch your eye
Somethin' special 'bout you

Big dreams in my head empty my tummy

Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone
Me say Mikey It's been a while, I'm not who I was before
You look surprised, your words don't burn me anymore
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it's clear to see
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free Careful with your ego, he's the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back
God know something had to change
I thought that you'd be happy
I found the one thing I need, why you mad
It's just the brand new kind of me It took a long long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised if i talk a little louder
If I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller
I'd be known to you too long
If you noticed that I'm different
Don't take it personally
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free Oh, it took a long long road to get here
It took a brave brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, oh see you look surprised Hey, if you were a friend, you want to get know me again
If you were worth a while
You'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry
I'm too busy finding myself
I got this
I found me, I found me, yeah I don't need your opinion
I'm not waiting for your okay
I'll never be perfect, but at least now I'm brave
Now, my heart is open
And I can finally breathe
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of free
That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
No, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had'
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again Oh oh oh How many really know what love is'
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(Can you do that for me baby)
Every time you touch me
(See we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(See everyday we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to promise me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(Like you'll never see me again) Oh oh oh oh oh This song is dedicated
To all the lovers who cant be together
Separated by distance and time You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? Know I never let you down
I will never go away I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Will you take a train, to meet me where I am
Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are

And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile

Oh oh oh oh She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Oh, oh, oh,
She's just a girl, and she's on fire Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over
That just wont be fair
Darling
Rather be a poor woman living on the street
No food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over
When you said goodbye! All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Now I see myself through different eyes
It's no surprise!
Being alone will make you realize
When it's over!
All in love is fair I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I know I pushed you away
What can I do that would save our love
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing
It's you that I want All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there, I shoulda, I shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Get so caught up everyday
Tryna keep it all together
While the time it slips away
You see I know nothing last forever Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late (I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait)
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait) Just a simple conversation
Just a moment is all it takes
I wanna be there just to listen
(I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
'Cause there's nothing that could fill that space
I don't wanna put it off for too long
I didn't say all that I had to say
I wanna take my time and right the wrong before we get to that place I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways

I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye

Trigger finger
For her majesty
Another one
With the
Golden tone voice
And then your fantasy
Another bill
From a killer
Turned a thrill
Into a tragedy Yeah, a door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die Another tricky little gun
Giving solace to the one
That will never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed
For your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money
Heaven sent honey
Turning on a dime Well, a door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just

On the world singing
Do what you want here
Another gun thrown down
And surrendered
Took away your fear

Behind you
Looking in the mirror A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye

But still you said the love was gone
And that I had to leave (Now you) talkin' bout a family
(Now you) sayin' I complete your dream
(Now you) sayin' I'm your everything
You're confusing me, what you say to me

What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
(What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn' And when you came home
You'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me
Like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want
Just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through (Now you) wanna be up under me

And never do what you supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you (What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me

To hold my mind, and be the kind
That I could talk to, this is the type of day
That I must say, I've been looking forward to Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here

Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love

Waiting for your love Talking on the phone
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades The way you take time for me
It makes me want you, call it what you want
It may be wrong but baby I'm your fool
I can verify that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear

Waiting for your love Some people they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away baby
'Cause there is nothing those bars can do I will be the rising moon after setting sun
Just to let you know that you'll always have someone
I will be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is I use to feel kinda lonely
'Cause the world it can be so fake
And all that matters I'm telling you
Is you and me only
And the fortunes of love we make I will be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you will always have my hand
I will be the woman you need to be a better man
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is Oh, can nothing break us down
Oh, cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain standing tall
And moving over here to stay
Oh, can nothing get in the way Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall (I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is
(that's how strong my love my love is)
Like a ship through the storm

And it was raining
Just to rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy about it
You'll say I told you so
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came 'round
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Sometimes
Some lies
Can take a minute
To fully realize
His tears
Your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You ought to see me now Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned I keep your picture upside my bed (umm)
And I still remember everything you said (umm)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (oh)
Always thought you'll be by my side
Pappa, now you're gone
What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me, anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you holding me tight
Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart
All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, pappa
Oh, you got to try
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Please (oh oh)
Won't you call me sometime, pappa Why don't you call me
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears
I need you right by my side Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, hallelujah
Woah, woah, hallelujah
All the places I've been
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Ooh, yeah
Uh, you know, hey
You know you may think
That you know you got me under wraps, locks and keys and
And that without you I just, I'm gonna be lost
But I got somethin' else for you Baby, I used to sit home waitin' for your call
I used to have your picture hangin' on my wall
Used to think you were right, but you was wrong
I used to miss you, now I'm glad that you're gone, I,

Ooh
Wait til they see your smile If war is holy and sex is obscene
We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptized in boundaries, schooled in sin
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin Oh, so we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
Yeah, we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked Oh, maybe we should love somebody
Oh, maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge Oh, so we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
Yeah, we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, you're open So maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if love is holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
'Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar There will never come a day
You will ever hear me say
That I want, or need to be without you
I wanna give my all Baby just hold me
Sweetly control me
Because your arms
they keep away the lonely When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I never felt this way about loving
No
Never felt so alive
Baby
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed that, this morning just so the world can see
Got them wolves on me, no watch me like em clean
I know, i know, my pride, my ghost, my eyes
My lows, i know i know, its mind control
I know i could prosper, no impostor
Prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by it what I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, gold is the only word i know And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on Ill simply say its on again, its on again
The world don't stop, it's on again I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, i sacrifice my ego
There is no room for selfish, we do it for the people And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on The work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop
And everybody here trying to get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Nah
So you think you're hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto) And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I've been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings

Because thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician and flatten composition A pain, I'm like Saddam Hussein
Still alive lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons The P's breathe Warriorz and skullies and Timmies
Around mixed, spics, niggaz and giddies

But all I know is everything's gonna be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everythings gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I?m telling you that No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh oh oh Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel? 'Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would bring But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please, send me an angel
Can you send me an angel? To guide me, to guide me home
[Incomprehensible] so bad, so bad right now
Oh, won't you be somebody's angel right now And the day came
When the risk it took to remain tightly closed in a bud
Was more painfully than the risk it took to bloom
This is the element of freedom I'll make the darkness light before you,
What is wrong I'll make it right before you,
All the battles I will fight down for you,
And the high place I'll bring down. And the high place I'll bring down. Mm, bye bye How do you love someone
That hurts you, oh, so bad
With intentions good?
Was all he ever had Well, how do I let go when I've loved him for so long
And I've given him all that I could? Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye) I know now I was naive
Never knew where this would lead, yeah
And I'm not tryin' to take away, oh no
From the good man that he is Well, how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could? Was it something wrong that we did?
Or 'cause others infiltrated?
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) Is this the end? Are you sure?
How should you know
When you've never been here before?
It's so hard to just let go
And this is the one and only love I've ever known, so (How do you find the words to say, to say goodbye
When your heart don't have the heart to say
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye When I wake up in the morning baby
Can't believe my eyes
It is this a part of destiny, you're now in my life (now in my life)
There is no better prize
Can't compare to you
Ain't no words to describe the way that I'm feeling, yeah
When I look at you I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away
I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say

Life becomes a way
Prettiest things imagine up, oh yea

And like a fairy tale your story begins
What a saint to the ... I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away
I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say

Go to the window and I smile with my eyes up
Staring at clouds like wow look at my love
Every day I'm feeling better cause I know I got the best I can be proud of
We came for quit, remember when I used to tell my girls like yo this dude thinks he's all eh, think he's so fly
And hates how you try to talk to me I'm like you're don't even there try
I was on my solo groove, I ain't want nothing, I ain't need nothing
Man I'm good, now I'm speechless, cause I fell for it, the poet in me died cause I fell for it I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away
I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah I used to know all the words to say, I used to write all the poetry
But now you take my breath away, hahaha, hey. Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Oh, oh, A-K!
New day
Oh, oh, A-K!
Ow! Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day,
Celebrate and say aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) It's alright to, to feel however you want to
There's no limitation, no
Fill up your life, let me see your hands up one time
We'll celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night, one time
Everybody say, "Aye aye oh" (oh) There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, "Aye

One life left to live it up There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up

It feels kinda crazy These covers
May keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place
'Cause they never gonna hold me tight And these pillows
May let me rest my head
But they can't say good night
And tuck me in before I go to bed Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else These lips are missin' you
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win These candles
Light up my room at night
But they can't light the room they way you did
When you walked inside, oh baby If these walls could sing
About everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad sad song
And it'll probably sound something like this Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
Cause I know I don't want nobody else 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over (Gonna be over)
When everything in this room reminds me of you (You)
Every time I think, I'm getting closer
'Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
I put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win And it feels so good
Don't you feel so good?
Talk to me Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know that nothing last forever, however
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow
Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart take me I follow, you gotta follow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life

When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Hey, ask when I wanna leave
A lifelong legacy, me loving you and you loving me
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow

Ev'ryone comes to stare at me

They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry They don't know what they're doing to me
keeping me from flying
That's why I say that I know why
the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free
so she can fly, fly, fly
spreading her wings and her song?
Let her fly, fly, fly
the whole world to see She's like a caged bird

Let's do it like this, uh If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man, yeah She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall 'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you
Yeah, yeah Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
No, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears Is it my turn to wish you was lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Or even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything Is it my turn to take you by your hands?
Tell you, I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand?
Watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you
Inside I'd die without you, yeah babe Oh I apologize for all the things I've done
Now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around?
Oh, take every little piece of my heart (Piece of my heart)
Take every little piece of my soul (Piece of my soul)
Take every little piece of my mind
'Cause if you're gone, inside, I'd die without you Yeah 'cause inside I'd die without you
Yeah baby I'd die without you
Can't you see that I would die without you? If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you Yeah I'd die without you
Oh don't you know that I would, die without you
Baby, see I would die without, I'd die without you
Oh die without you, die without you babe
I don't know what I'd do without you babe Have you ever felt so strong
That may you feel weak
Long days
Long nights
And you just can't sleep Have you ever been so sure
That gave you cold feet
That felt all bare
And can feel your heart beat I never known this feeling never
Now I hope it stays and last forever
I am riding high
I don't want come down
But wings don't here me out
If I can touch the sky
I risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'll give you all of my time Sometimes I feel
Like I don't belong anywhere
And it's gonna take so long
For me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel
So heavy hearted
But I can't explain
Cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bare
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Guide me In the morning when you wake
When I wanna face today and all your heartache
Thinking how much can you take
Please don't ever loose a faith and don't fall under In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
Through it all Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future
Just live in the moment
Long as there's another day here will be another way
A chance to make it through In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all When you're down and out
Loosing dignity
Don't let go of me (hold on)
Surely there's is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on)
If you really looked inside
You would finally realize
You don't have to cry (no more)
All you have to do is see
That you can believe in me
And I will never leave Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways
To escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say [Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
Its just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oh oh) Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say [Chorus] Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind [Chorus] Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay And I would be enough
And this could be enough
This would be enough Said, I would be enough
And this could be enough
See, we could be enough
Oh baby I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Ooh Don't look no further
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough (I could be enough)
We could have it all Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (ay)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And your family? (Me and your family?)
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
We can have it all (We could have it all)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
Yeah
Woo So look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around

Que tengo muy cerca para ver tu cara todos los días Contigo es donde
yo prefiero estar
pero estamos atrapados en esto
Y es tan difícil
Estás tan lejos
Esta distancia me está matando
Me gustaría que estuvieras aquí conmigo
pero estamos atrapados en esto.
Y es tan difícil
Estás tan lejos

Esta distancia me está matando Ahora los minutos
se sienten como horas
y las horas se sienten como días
Aunque estoy lejos

no puedo estar en casa
pero vuelvo a casa pronto

Que tengo muy cerca para ver tu cara todos los días
Contigo es donde
yo prefiero estar

Estás tan lejos
Esta distancia me está matando
Me gustaría que estuvieras aquí conmigo

Se está haciendo difícil esperar,
Estoy tratando de hacerle ver,
Que ella no sabe realmente
Que yo estoy tratando de encontrar una manera,
Y dile a ella todos los días, que sólo va de la mano
Así que ...
Yo no quiero ser,
El único que sabe
Que alguien podría venir y apenas
Dicen que el amor por mí,
Estoy de pie temblando de tierra,
Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo?
Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver,
Pero es que lo que
Siente esto debe ser.
Mi amor es como bala
Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda.
No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo,
Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más.
Hasta que me aviso,
Necesito saber en este momento
Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ...
Pero chica que me pone nervioso,
A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta.
¿Y qué va a tomar
Para la celestial ...
Me estás volviendo loco! Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Hey, hey, hey

More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it Look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You looking at me but I'm lookin' through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself I'm looking at the Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you re all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pain
I see the scars that remain
I see you Wayne, I'm lookin' at the Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again Lookin' at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fuckin' dad
Light it up, that's smoke at mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my momma smile that's a blessin'
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the Mirror on the wall, (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (take them to mars man)
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
Uh Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
Mirror on the wall
Hey BP, looks like I did take 'em to mars this time So why are we talkin' to each other again Man, look at you, been walking in here looking all pretty and angry and mean and good

But I was wrong, cause only with you
Can I move on (can I move on) When I'm weak, it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I forget to close my eyes
And listen to my heart

We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh See you down there everyday
Trying to find a different way
To build some kind of ladder to the sky Trying to find some way to see
Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once
And you don't know why Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart
See you when you cry yourself to sleep
It's tearing me apart I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand,
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you I know that you're waiting for,
A chance to come in from the war
If only a moment, if only a day A place where you feel safe and warm
A sanctuary from the storm
Until all of these questions fade away But I cannot count on all the signs
You've passed away as mere coincidence
And I'm running out of ways to break through
Like a lonely lover, Waiting by the ocean
I'll never give up on you I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand,
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin', playa hatin'
If this is how it's gonna be? I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you

Feeling sexy in your bedly
Touching me so gently
But I gotta get home So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Wish I could stay all night
But I just can't tonight
Cause I gotta be up at 6
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
And told me to come give you a kiss So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
[ Lyrics from:
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Something about you makes me wanna drive all night all night all night long
I can't wait when till the next time I see you (uh) home home Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Your telling me aint no rush to stay there's no delay oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh... Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
ah babe ah baby just take me the long way home Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Long turn on a dusty road
I did it to myself so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind
'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her door
'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run The good lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please please please
And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night
I spend my lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run I should've known better (I should've known better)
'Cause when we were together ('Cause when we were together)
She never said forever (She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played her game Hey, Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day baby
While I hide from the sun It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like
Until you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,
Waiting on the other side We would live forever
Who could ask for more
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like
Until you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,
Waiting on the other side If they say life's a dream
Call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland
It damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line
You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster
But I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,
Waiting on the other side It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

Oh, let's go

This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they know that I'm not myself when you gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight

where I am
if my father didn't tell me
to never say I can't

oh and they only thing he asked
right before he passed
was to never say you can't everything you taught me will stay with me forever

and I hope i can do for him what he did for me I wouldn't be

Her feathers they glow
Now the jungle's smiling
'Cause our baby's home
Can you feel what I feel?
The day has come at last
Our precious jewel has returned
I'll be the first to say welcome back
Oh welcome back I say welcome, welcome, welcome
Back Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
I say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are Yeah Oh, i was perfect
For the circus
if she dared me, i do it
Love makes you stupid
i gave it up, But i guess it was not enough
Cause she never seemed satisfied
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
Oohh x2 she set the bar
Just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it
But i still kept on reaching
she watched me try
At least a thousand times
If she loved me, She'd stop me But noo
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
I saw something worth my future
So wrong So wrong
In my mind i was all it took
But i guess i wasn't wrong
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?

It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see,
That she don't really know
That I'm trying to find a way,
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I...
I don't wanna be,
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground,
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it, Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost. I'm already lost. I wish that I could see,
What is making you
Feel that you should be concerned.
My love is like a gunshot
All it takes is one shot for me to blow it all away.
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time,
It's gotta be with you and no one else.
Do you notice me,
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost. Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous,
By now you should have noticed me.
And what will it take it
To a heavenly because your
drawing chains and
driving me insane! Chorus:
Girl,I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost. Hands over my head thinking
What else could go wrong
Would've stayed in bed
How could a day be so long? Never believe that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt so believe That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you I missed the first train stood out
In the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train
And there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for Never believed that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt So believe that for you
I'd do it all over again, do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again Oh, who ever thought a day gone
So wrong could turn out so lovely
Yeah, I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing Yeah, yeah, I'ma do it
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again Do it all over again, I'd do it all over again
I'd do all over again for you
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows You've been livin this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows Chorus:

It seems like every other night you pick a fight, fight.
And I know I do the same, be callin' you out your name,
This is not what lovers are suppose to do. You tell me to go, I start walkin out,
We both know what we're all about.
We fuss, fight, and scream,
And it's all because of love,
but you know we ain't ever giving up. Everytime I try to leave
Somethin's tells me turn around
'Cause how could I ever leave
The only one that holds me down
'Cause I know we can work it out
Talk it out, stick it out oohh
Everytime I try to leave
Find that we can figure it out
That's why I always turn around Baby, before you say, say,
Something you know you'll take back later on today, day.
Sometimes you drive me crazy, but I love ya, baby
All I ask is that you'll always appreciate me, ooohh. You tell me to go, I start walkin out,
We both know what we're all about.
We fuss, fight, and scream,
And it's all because of love,
but you know we ain't ever giving up. Everytime I try to leave
Somethin's tells me turn around
'Cause how could I ever leave
The only one that holds me down
'Cause I know we can work it out
Talk it out, stick it out oohh
Everytime I try to leave
Find that we can figure it out
That's why I always turn around Ain't nobody that can love me, like you love me.
That's why I always turn around for you, you you, youuu. You, you you, youuu.
Ain't nobody that can love me, like you love me.
Thats why I always turn around. For you, you you, youuuu. You, you yooou. Everytime I try to leave
Somethin's tells me turn around
'Cause how could I ever leave
The only one that holds me down
'Cause I know we can work it out
Talk it out, stick it out oohh
Everytime I try to leave
Find that we can figure it out
That's why I always turn around Here I am again, doing things I said that I wouldn't do
It's 3AM and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting, all day, but now you wanna call me
Why do you do this to me all the time? After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
Cause I loved you, loved you, loved you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl with no one to turn you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything After all the things you put me through, ooh still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely Oh, nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on Cause I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it

Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
I say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are Yeah ¿Qué estás loco?
Se está haciendo difícil esperar,
Estoy tratando de hacerle ver,
Que ella no sabe realmente
Que yo estoy tratando de encontrar una manera,
Y dile a ella todos los días, que sólo va de la mano
Así que ...
Yo no quiero ser,
El único que sabe
Que alguien podría venir y apenas
Dicen que el amor por mí,
Estoy de pie temblando de tierra,
Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo?
Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver,
Pero es que lo que
Siente esto debe ser.
Mi amor es como bala
Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda.
No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo,
Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más.
Hasta que me aviso,
Necesito saber en este momento
Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ...
Pero chica que me pone nervioso,
A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta.
¿Y qué va a tomar
Para la celestial ...
Me estás volviendo loco! Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. [Verse 1:]
I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while
But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Can't wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more Oooh [Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you [Verse 2:]
Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothin' to lose
I've got nothin' to lose [Chorus:]
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you [Bridge:]
Girl when you smile
Not a place I'd rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you'll see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya
Oh, and now you know
And now you know [Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by
I stayed the same
She began to drift away
I was left alone Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart When she loved me, hey Sentimentos são
Fáceis de mudar
Mesmo entre quem
Não vê que alguém
Pode ser seu par Basta um olhar
Que o outro não espera
Para assustar e até perturbar
Mesmo a bela e a fera Sentimento assim
Sempre é uma surpresa
Quando ele vem
Nada o detém
É uma chama acesa Sentimentos vêm
Para nos trazer
Novas sensações
Doces emoções
E um novo prazer E numa estação
Como a primavera
Sentimentos são
Como uma canção
Para a bela e a fera Sentimentos são
Como uma canção
Para a bela e a fera Para a bela e a fera Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of your world You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know
You don't know You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends How high will the sycamore grow
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind It's a small world, it's a small world
It's a small world, it's a small world It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all (Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world There is just one moon and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to everyone
Though the mountains be wide and the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all (Come on, come on) (Everybody now) it's a small world after all (can you hear me now) it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world It's a small world after all, no matter if you're big or small
Come on everybody let's bounce to this
Let's play some love with a little twist
It's a small world, it's a small world It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all, it's a small world (Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world (can you hear me now?) It's a small world after all (come on, come on)
It's a small, small, small, small world (come on, come on)
It's a small world, after all (can you hear me now?) It's a small world after all (come on, come on)
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small, small, small world (pretty small eh) It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world
It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will loose your heartache
Whatever you wish for, you keep Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true Oh, that clock!
Oh, killjoy
I hear you, come on, get up you say
Time to start another day
Even he orders me around
Well, there's one thing
They can't order me to stop dreaming
And perhaps someday
The dreams that I wish will come true No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see
That if I were truly to be myself
I would break my fam'ly's heart Who is that girl I see
Staring straight
Back at me?
Why is my reflection someone
I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside? When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those to love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true Belle:
There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before Beast:
She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before Belle:
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see Lumiere:
Well, who'd have thought? Mrs Potts:
Well, bless my soul Cogsworth:
Well, who'd have known? Mrs Potts:
Well, who indeed? Lumiere:
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own? Mrs Potts:
It's so peculiar,
Wait and see. All three:
We'll wait and see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before Cogsworth:
Well here's a thought, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before Chip:
What mama? Mrs Potts:
There may be something there that wasn't there before If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history, been there, done that
Who d'you think you're kidding
He's the earth and heaven to you
Try to keep it hidden
Honey we can see right through you (Oh no)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you're feeling
Who you thinking of?
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no
You swoon, you sigh, why deny it, oh, oh
It's too cliché, I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "get a grip, girl"
"Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"
Girl, you can't deny it
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby we're not buying
Hon we saw you hit the ceiling
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up that you got, got, got it bad?
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no no
Give up, give in, check the grin, you're in love
This scene won't play, I won't say I'm in love
We'll do it until you admit you're in love
You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
Girl don't be proud, it's okay you're in love
At least out loud I won't say I'm in love Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say Bonjour
Bonjour
Bonjour Bonjour Bonjour There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good Morning, Belle
'Morning, Monsieur
Where are you off to
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre and a
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes hurry up Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle Bonjour
Good day
How is your family Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife I need six eggs
That's too expensive There must be more than this provincial life Ah, Belle
Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed
Finished already
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
Ha Ha! Not since yesterday
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
That one? But you've read it twice
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights
magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours
But sir
I insist
Well, thank you. Thank you very much Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three Now it's no wonder that her name means "beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one
Hmm the inventor's daughter
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute Bonjour
Pardon
Good day
Mais oui
You call this bacon
What lovely grapes
Some cheese
Ten yards
One pound
'Scuse me
I'll get the knife
Please let me through
This bread
Those fish
It's stale
They smell
Madame's mistaken There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle Master, I don't think you quite realize what you got here!
So, why don't you just ruminate,
Whilst I illuminate the possibilities! Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves,
Scheherazade had a thousand tales.
But master you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves
You've got a brand of magic never fails You've got some power in your corner now!
Some heavy ammunition in your camp!
You got some punch, pizzaz, yahoo and how...
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say: Chorus:
"Mr. Aladdin, sir, what will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down?"
You ain't never had friend like me Life is your restaurant and I'm your maitre'd
Come on whisper what it is you want;
You ain't never had friend like me! Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service.
You're the boss, the king, the shah.
Say what you wish; it's yours, true dish.
How 'bout a little more baklava? Have some of column A try All of column B,
I'm in the mood to help you, dude.
You ain't never had friend like me Oh my. No no. My my my.
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Well looky here!
Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip,
And then make the sucker disappear? So don't just sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed,
I'm here to answer all your midnight prayers,
You've got me bona fide certified;
You've got a genie for charge d'affaires. I've got a powerful urge to help you out,
So what you wish, I really wanna know?
You've got a list that's three miles long, no doubt,
Well all you've gotta do is rub like so, and oh ­- Mr. Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three.
I'm on the job you big nabob!
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend like me.
You ain't never had a friend like me The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for? Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate? Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea) Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here
Naturally (Naturally)
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
(Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow Yeah, under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea)
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me (It's music to me)
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea [Gramma Tala:]
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana you've come so far
Moana listen
Do you know who you are? [Moana:]
Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me
It's like the tide; always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana! The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself
Can you do that? My dear, sweet child, that's what I do
It's what I live for
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
To this
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (Pathetic) Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them
Yes I do Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls Have we got a deal?
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again
But you'll have your man
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh, and there is one more thing
We haven't discussed the subject of payment
But I don't have-
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle
What I want from you is your voice
But without my voice, how can I-
You'll have your looks, your pretty face
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha! The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle babble for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead
Make your choice
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me Now, sing
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah
Keep singing!
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah (Spoken) Mama, I don't have time for dancing
(Sung) That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style This old town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
I'm getting closer and closer everyday And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People 'round here think I'm crazy
But I don't care Trials and tribulations
I've had my share
But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Cause I'm almost there I remember daddy told me
"Fairy tales can come true
But you gotta make it happen
It all depends on you" So I work real hard each and everyday
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there I'm almost there There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there I'm almost there I'm almost there I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream The King and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will, we'll roam. Yo ho, all hands,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Now, some have died and some are alive
and others sail on the sea.
With the keys to the cage
and the devil to pay,
we lay to the fiddler's green. Yo ho haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The bell has been raised
from its watery grave,
hear its sepulchral tone.
A call to all; pay heed the squall,
and turn your sails to home. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The king and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will; we'll roam. So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light I knew I'd never know that warm and loving glow
Though I might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me
And as I ring these bells tonight
My cold dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be Heaven's light Confiteor deo omnipotenti

Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul

(In thought) I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control
Verbo et opere
(In word and deed) Like fire, Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning desire
Is turning me to sin
It's not my fault Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
I'm not to blame
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) It is the gypsy girl

Mea culpa

Stronger than a man
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault) Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped
What? No longer in the cathedral, she's gone
But how? Never mind, get out, you idiot
I'll find her, I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris Hellfire, dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn

Be mine or you will burn Kyrie Eleison

But she will be mine
Or she will burn I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my ROAR
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
(You've rather a long way to go, young master
if you think) No one saying do this
(Now when I said that, I)
No one saying be there
(What I meant was)
No one saying stop that
(Look, what you don't realize) No one saying see here
(Now see here!)
Free to run around all day
(Well, that's definitely out)
Free to do it all my way!
I think it's time that you and I Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm Standing in spotlight!
Not yet!
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king! A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say

The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on Just smile, and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do If we send it on, on and on

That's the time that they begin it
Cinderelly, Cinderelly (Cinderella!) Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire, fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes, do the mopping
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping
She goes around in circles till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler "Keep a-busy, Cinderelly!" We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'

And I can do the sewing!
Leave the sewing to the women
You go get some trimmin'
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo! We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly! Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells The bells of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin
(Kyrie Eleison)
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum sibylla
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
And for one time in his live
Of power and control
(Kyrie Eleison)
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better) I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then we'll be together,
Somewhere out there,
Out where dreams
Come true... There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she wants you too
There is one way to ask her
It don't take a word
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl Sing with me now
Sha la la la la la
My oh my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame?
Too bad, he gonna miss the girl Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl Sha la la la la la
Don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Don't stop now
Don't try to hide it how
You want to kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Float along
And listen to the song
The song say kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
The music play
Do what the music say
You got to kiss the girl
You've got to kiss the girl
You wanna kiss the girl
You've gotta kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay

Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro!
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O. He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he a hot shot
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that! When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on ev'ry vase
(On every vahse) From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian "earn"! Say "Amen"
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
From zero to hero
A major hunk
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk? Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver!
Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor! Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a hot-shot
He's our hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed! From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero Yes indeed! Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells off you go
Like reindeer in the sky You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Up you go with a height and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly I've been standing at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
No one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful baby Did your granny say listen to your heart?
Be who you are on the inside?
I need three words to tear her argument apart: your granny lied I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't ya know
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh and here they come, come, come to the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm fish dinners
I just love free food (free food) and you look like sea food (sea food) Well, well, well
Little Maui's havin' trouble with his look
You little semi, demi, mini god
Ouch what a terrible performance get the hook
Get it?
You don't swing it like you used to, man
Yet I have to give you credit from my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide
I can't I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You can try, try, try but you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod
Look it up
You will die, die, die now it's time for me to take apart your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasin' the love of the humans who made you feel wanted
You tried to be tough but your armor's just not hard enough
Maui, now it's time to kick your heiney
Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie, mon ami
I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny What I love most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me, coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend, just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, dream giver
Just around the river bend? In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun and snap!
The job's a game And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see that A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way The honey bee that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb
Never tired of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip
And hence (And hence)
They find (They find)
Their task is not a grind Ah, ah, ah! Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight,

And I've bought some corn for popping

Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Yes, salagadoola means
Mechicka booleroo
But the thing mabob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo I got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion by reaching out for each other's hand Maybe we'll discover
What we shoulda known all along
One way or another, together's where we both belong If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love'll lead us
And find a way to bring me to you So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you drown
(Nothing's gonna stop us now) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Love is why we're seein' it eye to eye
(Yes, we are seein' it eye to eye)
Seein' it eye to
(Love is why we're seein' it)
I think we're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye)
eye to
We're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye!) If you're ever lonely, then stop!
You don't have to be
After all, it's only a beat away from you to me
(Take a look inside and see) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Seein' it eye to
Seein' it eye to eye
We're seein' it eye to eye, baby
For the first time

To see her is to
Take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella
She's like a spider waiting
For the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil At first you think
Cruella is the devil
But after time has worn
Away the shock
You come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath
A rock! This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up
And never released
The world was such
A wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Well next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue? The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Oh man this is really living
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true The bare necessities of life will come to you Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
With just the bare necessities of life I see what's happening yeah
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me
It's Maui, breathe it in
I know its a lot; the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy Hey!
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh!
Also I lassoed the sun
(You're welcome)
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
(You're welcome!)
To fill your sails and shake your trees So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
Ha! I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome!
You're welcome! Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide? The grass? The ground?
Oh, that was Maui just messin' around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tickety-tappin'
Heh, heh, heh ,heh, heh, heh, hey! Well anyway, let me say you're welcome (You're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (You're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go!
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float! (You're welcome)
You're welcome! (You're welcome)

Disney
2000 Leagues Under the Sea
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Mermaid Minnie
Met her down in Madagascar
She would kiss me
Anytime that I would ask her
Then one evening
Her flame of love blew out
Blow me down and pick me up,
She swapped me for a trout!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Typhoon Tessie
Met her on the coast of Java
When we kissed I
Bubbled up like molten lava
Then she gave me
The scare of my young life
Blow me down, and pick me up
She was the captain's wife!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
Then there was Harpoon Hannah
Had a face that made you shudder
Lips like Fish hooks
And a nose just like a rudder
If I kissed her
And held her tenderly
(Held her tenderly)
There's no sea monster big enough
To ever frighten me!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo! With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in a flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! When you send it flyin' up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over 'ouses and trees
With your first 'olding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
When you're standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today
I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
The nice things he'll say I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today Today!
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One Song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say goodbye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you? Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon (Ou mata e matagi)
I have crossed the horizon to find you
(Ou loto mamaina toa)
I know your name
(Manatu atu)
They have stolen the heart from inside you
(Taku pelepele)
But this does not define you
(Manatu atu)
This is not who you are
You know who you are Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of your world When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by
I stayed the same
She began to drift away
I was left alone Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart When she loved me, hey All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you Now that I see you Wonderful, marvelous,
The man with the strength of many.
Brave and bold with a heart of gold,
John Henry was a mighty man.
Born with a hammer right in his hand. Well, come on John,
You're the one that we're depending on.
Swing that hammer with all your might,
I know you can show them how to do it right. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer,
A ten pound hammer,
A twenty pound hammer right in his hand. I heard John's mama liked to sew at night,
So he pulled down the moon for a little bit of light.
It took a lot of cooking to keep John fed,
Ten dozen eggs and eight loves of bread. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. He plowed the earth so wide and deep,
The seed he sowed the ground had to keep.
His hammer hit the earth with such a mighty blow,
Everything he planted would jump up and grow. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
All our lives we've been so poor,
John let me show you what we're working for. Canaan Land, Canaan Land,
Everybody workin' for the Canaan Land.
Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. Oh, movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time.
Movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time. Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man. Steel drivin' man,
John Henry was.
Steel drivin' man,
Oh yes he was.
So proud, defiant,
A gentle giant,
A steel drivin' natural man. Well, a-come on, John,
You're the one that we're dependin' on.
Swing that hammer, bust that rock,
Come on, give it everything you've got. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. John and the drill made the valley shake,
Rumblin' almost caused an earthquake.
Thunder and lightning was everywhere,
Oh, Lord, that battle was beyond compare. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. No mountain too high,
No valley too low,
No river too wide,
No place too far to go. If you believe, you can overcome.
The battle is already won,
Just keep on keepin' on.
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. Do you wanna build a snowman?

I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the
Pictures on the walls It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms (these empty rooms)
Just watching the hours
Tick by Do you wanna build a snowman?
(Do you wanna build a snowman?)
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Don't have to be a snowman)
Okay, bye Elsa?

It's just you and me
What are we gonna do? (what are we gonna do?) Do you wanna build a snowman?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know Some day when spring is here
We'll find a love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true La la lu, La la lu
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust for you La la lu, La la lu
Little soft fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud for you La la lu, La la lu
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings close your eyes La la lu, La la lu
And may love be your keeper
La la lu, La la lu, La la lu Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Why, when he was a young warthog
When I was a young wart-hoooog!
Very nice!
Thanks!
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame
(He was ashamed!)
Thought of changin' my name
(Oh, what's in a name?)
And I got downhearted
(How did you feel?)
Every time that I-
Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!
Oh... sorry Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
Yeah, sing it, kid!
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love
Mmmmmm
So this is love
So this is what makes life divine
I'm all aglow, mmmmmm
And now I know
And now I know
The key to all heaven is mine
My heart has wings, mmmmmm
And I can fly
I'll touch every star in the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love Oh, this is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte This is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte Look at me,
I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart. Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside? I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best Ou mata e matagi

But once you know what you like, well
There you are You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

You can blame my friends on the other side You got what you wanted
What you want's what you get
Hush Ain't it a glorious day?
Right as a mornin' in May
I feel like I could fly
Have you ever seen the grass
So green, or a bluer sky? Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
Gentlemen like you are few
Though you're just a diamond
In the rough, Bert
Underneath your blood is blue!
You'd never think of pressing
Your advantage
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
A lady needn't fear when you are near
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear!
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
A jolly, jolly holiday with you! It's true that Mavis and Sybil 'ave
Ways that are winning
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
Set your 'eart spinning
Phoebe's delightful, Maude is disarming
Janice, Felicia, Lydia--charming
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat
Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane
Convivial company, time and again
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports
But cream of the crop, tip of the top
It's Mary Poppins, and there we stop! If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be And if I never knew you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you If I never knew you
I'd be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel
A love so strong and true I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you I thought our love would be so beautiful Somehow we made the whole world bright I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night
But still my heart is singing
We were right If I never knew you
There's no moment I regret
If I never knew this love
I would have no inkling of
If our time has gone too fast I've lived at last
How precious life can be I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright I thought our love would be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light And still my heart is singing
We were right We were right
And if I never knew you
I'd have lived my whole life through Empty as the sky Never knowing why
Lost forever I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
Just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got troubles, well I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and we see it through
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you
And as the years go by
Boys, our friendship will never die
You're gonna see
It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I've got no strings
To hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown
I had strings
But now I'm free
There are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o
That's the only way to go
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me I've got no strings
So I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings
But you can see
There are no strings on me You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ya, ya, ya
If you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings
Comme ci comme ca
Your savoire-faire is ooh la la
I've got strings
But entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go
But I'd rather go with you, hey There are no strings on me Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
And hold it tight I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry For one so small,
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you,
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all And you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you
But you got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever more You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Always I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there
Always 
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
It rode us all the way to New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues

Child, the living's easy.
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, Lord,
Cotton's high, Lord so high. Your daddy's rich
And your ma is so good-looking, baby.
She's a-looking good now,
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Don't you cry, don't you cry. One of these mornings
You're gonna rise, rise up singing,
You're gonna spread your wings, child,
And take, take to the sky,
Lord, the sky. But until that morning,
Honey, n-n-nothing's going to harm ya,
No, no, no no, no no, no,
Don't you cry, don't you cry. Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Honey, welcome back home. I know she told you,
Honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did,
But all I know is that she left you,
And you swear that you just don't know why,
But you know, honey I'll always,
I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Oh honey, welcome back home. Don't you know, honey,
Ain't nobody ever gonna love you
The way I try to do ?
Who'll take all your pain,
Honey, your heartache, too ?
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Oh daddy, like you always saying to do. And when you walk around the world, babe,
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road,
You might find out later that the road'll end in detroit,
Honey, the road'll even end in kathmandu.
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby,
When you only gotta do one thing well,
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe.
You got a woman waiting for you there,
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that'll be the end of the road, babe,
I know you got more tears to share, babe,
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
And cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby. Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless, aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed It's the heart, afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong Just remember, in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lie the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose Sitting down by my window,
Whoa, whoa, looking at the rain.
Whoa, down by my window, baby,
And all around me,
I said suddenly I felt the rain.
Somethin' grabbed a hold of me, darling,
Honey, it felt to me, honey like, yeah, a ball and chain.
Oh honey, you know what I mean,
It just hurts me. Say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, honey, it can't be
Whoa, it can't be, babe,
Said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, hey.
Whoa, baby, it just can't be
Every time I want to reach out my hand.
No, no, no, no, no, babe, baby, never, no, no,
Never, never, no, no, no.
Here you gone today, but I wanted to love you, darling,
Oh, till the end of time,
Yeah! All right! Love's got a hold on me baby
Feels like a ball and chain.
Oh, love just draggin' me down, yeah yeah yeah,
Feels like, honey sometimes it feels honey like a ball, yeah like a ball and a chain
Wonder why when I did the very best I could to love you
You wanted to leave me here, honey in so much pain
Come on, honey, I want you to tell me, please, yeah. Say oh, oh, oh, oh,
Honey this can't be
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no yeah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Honey, this can't be just because I want to want you
Does this mean I have to hide to cry, cry all the time?
I just wanted to love you, darling,
Every day, oh, whoa, 'till the, to the very end, to the end of time,
Yeah, no no no no no, hit it! Love's got a hold on me, baby,
Feels like a ball and chain.
Oh, love's holdin' on to me,
Feels to me, oh like a ball and a chain
Honey somethin' will grab around the knees, grab me in my heart,
Feels to me like a ball and a chain now,
Yeah, alright, yeah! Say oh, oh oh oh,

Tell me, tell me, darling please

Tell me why, sometimes darling

Sometimes I feel, honey, honey that I need to know why
I said baby when I ask you
I could use a little help sometime
When I say, I say tell me, come on man,
Tell me, tell me, babe,
Honey I never understood, why when I want to work my hands out,
I want to wear my hands out, I try the very best I can, babe
Why you always want to go, honey and let me down baby.
I said why I always want to go, honey drag me around.
Seems like anything, it could be the telephone company man,
it could be the man I love, I always got something else going, you know what I mean ?
Over on the other side, say, not quite got it right this very minute.
I'm so sorry babe, I said I'm so very sorry babe,
But I never did promise you nothing, right ? I see what you mean.
Come on, man, now come on, that ain't the name of it,
And that ain't the end of it, you know what I mean.
Sometimes, it feels just about breaking things, you know what I mean.
Just like, just like a grave, just like a grave to call
Just like a cry to call.
Honey I never understood and I said please
Lord, I swear I never understood and I say please
I want you to help me, fill it up baby,
I want you to help me, I said allow me to hear
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please,

Feels so bad on my back, babe,
Feels just like a ball,
Feels like a ball, ball, oh daddy feels like a ball,
And a chain. You say that it's over baby, Lord,
You say that it's over dear,
But still you hang around me, come on,
Won't you move over. You know that I need a man, honey,
You know that I need a man,
But when I ask you to you just say
That you think you can. Please don'tcha do it to me babe, no!
Please don'tcha do it to me baby,
Either take the love I offer
Or let me be. I ain't quite a ready for walking, no!
I ain't quite a ready for walking,
But whatcha gonna do with your life,
Life all just dangling ? Hey! Make up your mind, honey,
You're playing with me.

But whatcha gonna do with your love,
Love all just dangling ? Honey, I fear that it's dangling,
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord!

Like a carrot, yeah.
Like a carrot baby now,
Like a carrot baby.
Like a carrot baby!
Like a carrot darling!
Like a carrot baby!
Like a carrot baby!
Like a carrot dear!
All right, daddy, take it all! I'll tell you something, man,
I never expected that out of Toronto, man.
You're looking real good, real good
In fact you're all invited to my house for a drink.
I live in San Francisco and if you can get there man,
I'll give you the drink.
I promise.
I ain't too hard to find, ha ha ha ha ha
I'm all over the streets, man.
Ha Ha. I'm not. A while back, it was about a year ago,
I think it was, I had this apartment in San Francisco,
I lived on the third floor in this little tiny apartment building,
Had a little two rooms and a dog, right. I lived on the third floor and I used to walk around town and I had,
You know, a couple of pairs of Levis and a couple T-shirts
And I thought I had my shit pretty good together, man. You know I was out on the streets talking and talking,
Doing all that shit, and every time I found a nice piece of talent
He went right straight downstairs to the chick on the second floor,
There was another chick on the second floor, right. And I couldn't understand, I couldn't understand,
I kept thinking, Janis, why are you doing wrong suddenly ?
Well I so decided to get up one morning, ha ha ha,
And check out the chick's action, right,
Figure out what she had going that I didn't have going. I got up at 9:30 in the morning,
Which I want you to know is an effort on my part.
And I got up at 9:30 in the morning,
I hid in the stairwell right next
To the chick's across from her apartment, right.
And I watched her and watched to see what she had, man,
That I didn't have. And I'll tell you what she had man,
That chick hit the streets at noon.
I mean I didn't use to get up till three.
That chick was already in the street hustling, man.
So I figured out what you gotta do, man.
Every time you're looking for a little piece of action
And you ain't getting none, man,
You know what you better do, baby,
You better try harder, man. Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday. Now all you men's the same
But now I'm old enough to change my name.

I may wind up in the street or sleep beneath a tree,
Still I guess you know, honey I've gotta go. Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.
Lord, I might've been your wife,
But you settled for a place right in my heart,
You didn't want a place in my life. So long, my honey, so long.

I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah

We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm

From denyin', from denyin'. And I say you don't say no, no, no, to me no more.

It's fantastic! I was across the river from the club last night, I never had more fun in my life! except sometimes in california I have more fun.
Do you plan to come back soon ?
Oh ? er, er, er, I have no immediate plans, ha ha ha!!
Did you entertain in high school, at the high school, when you went back at the high school ?
Only when I walked down the aisles, man. no, I did, no, I was, er, I was a painter, and a sort of a recluse in high school. I've changed.
What happened ?
I got liberated! I don't know, I just started to sing and singing makes you want to come out because painting, I feel, keeps you inside, you know ? and once you start singing you just sort of wa
O talk to people more and go out more and, you know, your lifestyle's becomes more a come-out, flow-out thing instead of a hold-it-and-be-quiet type.
How were you different from your schoolmates when you were a teenager ?
I don't know, why don't you ask them ?
Did they make you different ?
No.
Otherwise were you different in comparison with them, or were you ?
I felt apart from them.
Did you take a part in football games ?
I think not. I didn't go to the high school prom, and er ...
Oh, you were asked, weren't you ?
No, I wasn't. I don't think, I don't think they wanted to take me. till I'll be a hundred and sufferin'! it's enough to make you wanna sing the blues! Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
It rode us all the way to New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm

Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGhee, yeah A woman left lonely will soon grow tired of waiting,
She'll do crazy things, yeah, on lonely occasions.
A simple conversation for the new men now and again
Makes a touchy situation when a good face come into your head.
And when she gets lonely, she's thinking 'bout her man,
She knows he's taking her for granted, yeah yeah,
Honey, she doesn't understand, no no no no! Well, the fevers of the night, they burn an unloved woman
Yeah, those red-hot flames try to push old love aside.
A woman left lonely, she's the victim of her man, yes she is.
When he can't keep up his own way, good Lord,
She's got to do the best that she can, yeah!
A woman left lonely, Lord, that lonely girl,
Lord, Lord, Lord! Oh, sweet Mary, child of confusion, she runs the hills to cry
Past the willows or an illusion, Lord, tell me the reason why.
Tell me why, why is it all so hard ?
Breathing in the air Breathe in the air
Anyone to care.
Oh!
(Alright, yeah!)
Oh, sweet Mary, in our story, have we nothing left to give ?
But don't we all know, babe, if we're pressed to, that that's the way we live.
Tell me why, why is it all so hard ?
Breathing in the air Breathing in the air
Anyone to care, oh, yeah!
Hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now,
Hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, whoa, yeah! Janis it's a shame you couldn't do an up tune for us but I liked that one.
Later in the show.
Yeah, maybe later we'll be talking too. you're really shot after, after a number, let alone a whole evening I would think.
Yeah, yeah.
You tell me you kind of collapse after a show ?
Well, I'm used to it because I'm so turned on by doing one that it's hard to do, it's hard to stop after one to tell you the truth, because it just makes you wanna do more.
Your engine is revved up ?
Yeah, sort of!
I know all the hip expressions, you see. your engine is revved up.
You're a real swinger, I can tell by your shoes, man!
Wait a minute, janis, janis. these were good enough for my grand-father, they're good enough for me.
I had a lot of trouble, last week i, er, it wasn't that tune, we opened with another tune and I tore a muscle.
I heard about this. you tore a mussel somewhere near maryland. er ...
It was closer to home than that!
Well, er ...
But I played forty minutes, man! I did forty minutes!
Yeah, but how do you, how do you tear a muscle singing, was it from the exhaustion or ...
No, I went ... like that.
You actually, literally tore a muscle ... I mean like that ...
Every time, it hurt.
Could you feel it go ?
Yeah.
Phew!
Yeah.
What do they do, do they set a muscle or do they tape you up or something ?
They told me to keep still.
Janis you wrote that tune that you were just singing like we just agreed to ask about. you er, you wrote the first tune, right ?
I wrote the first tune. it's, er, yes I did, it's about men.
It's about men. it's a little hard to tell what it was about 'cause I was standing over there where the sound is a little distorted.
Well in my story that's what it is anyway.
Yeah.
D'you ever see those mule carts ?
Yeah.
They, er, there's a dumb mule on there right and a long stick with a string and a carrot, and it hangs over the mule's nose, and it runs after it all day long. some ...
Who is the man in this, in this parable, the mule, or the person holding the carrot ?
No, the woman is the, is the mule. chasing something that somebody's holds her way.
Constantly chasing her man ...
Yeah.
... who always eludes her.
Well, they always hold something more than they're prepared to give.
I have to defend my entire sex, ladies and gentlemen! the burden of the defense.
Go right ahead!
Well, one-arm wrestling I can take you two out of three.
I hope so.
Do you, er, do you actually sit down when you get up in the morning and, and write out a song, or do you . . . when you say you write it, you compose it you write it on a paper.
You just make it up, I don't write songs, I make them up.
They don't exist on paper your songs, don't they ?
Sometimes I just write down the words so I don't forget 'em, but I mean I don't write songs, that's a whole different concept. I just make 'em up.
Yeah. did you ever get back to port arthur, texas ?
No, but I'm going back next in august, man. and guess what I'm doin' ?
I don't know.
I'm going to my 10th annual high school reunion.
Oh! oh! take movies and bring 'em back to show us, will you ?
Hey would you like to go ?
Well, I don't remember, I don't have any friends in your high school class.
I don't either. I don't either, believe me.
You don't either ?
It's hard going, man!
Weren't you a kind of a, weren't you kind of a business administration major or something in high school. no, it's something in your past. you were ...
No, I worked.
Yeah.
But a high school major in art does have plenty of time.
Yeah. and do you think you'll have a lot to say to your old high-school classmates ?
I don't have a lot, man.
You were not surrounded by friends in high school ?
They laughed me out of class, out of town, and out of state, man.
Hmm ...
Somethin' goin' on.
Thank you.
Thank you. Whoa, I need a man to love me.
Don't you understand me, baby ?

Make it the last time, oh darling please.
But I don't understand why you always pick the time
When I've just talked to you with your love on my mind.
To see a distant light, to hear a far-off horn
To leave me one more time, I can't stand no more
Say no more, well no more,
Well no more, darling, please.
And every time you leave I make the very same vow
That when you come back I ain't gonna love you no how.
But when you return you look so fine to me
I can't stand no more, my darling, it's just got to be
I said the last time, oh the last time,
Oh the last time, darling, please.
Don't you understand me, don't you understand me ?
Honey, don't you understand my word ?
Well, you told me that you love me, I believed you, darling,
But you lied, you know it's true.
Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving
Then I'll cry.
Oh darling, oh darling,
Oh darling, make up your mind
Oh, I can't stand your loving, honey, it's tearing me apart,
You done got my soul, but now you're after my heart.
Well, don't hurt me, darling, now you know how to do it so well
I just got one consolation, I just wail
It was the last time
It was the last time
It was the last time, darling, please.
When you told me that you love me I believed you, darling,
But you lied, you know it's true.
Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving
Then I'll cry.
Well no more, well no more,
Well no more without you, please!
If you wanna love me, honey, please stay home,
If you don't wanna love me, baby, please stay gone.
Don't you understand me, don't you understand me ?
Don't you understand my words ?
Say no more, oh no more,
Well no more, oh, darling, oh!
You told me that you love me I believed you, darling,
But you lied, you know it's true.
Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving
Then I'll cry, yeah. Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.
Go ahead! I don't want your golden mansions with a tear in every room,
All I want's the love you promised, beneath the halo moon.
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow while you play your cheatin' game. Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine. [Instrumental] Now when I go to work, I work all day,
Always turns out the same.
When I bring home my hard-earned pay
I spend my money all on mary jane.
Mary jane, mary jane, lord, my mary jane. Oh if a man should look tame now, mean and mature,
They all turn out the same.

Don't take your sweet, sweet love from me! Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
It rode us all the way to New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee La da da

Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGhee, yeah   
Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares, still the Louvre Okay I know that you are not my type (still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night, 'cause All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? (Go back and tell it) Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you 'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go
Yeah I guess I should go Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome I light all the candles
Got flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you've outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak
It was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries
How you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah "What is this tape?"
"This is my favorite tape" Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess why? I like that
'Cause I kinda miss your life fucked
Kinda wanna tape my mouth shut

Generation
L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S Break the news, you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn up town, no post code envy But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy ooh ooh oh ooh
We're better than we've every dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen ooh ooh oh ooh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar Those great whites, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you All those rumors, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room Dancing around the lies we tell
Dancing around big eyes as well, ah
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell [Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release [Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there [Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know (One, two) Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight Oh god, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move along with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see every
Ribbon you used to tie yourself to me But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me? King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care (but what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober? Oh God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor, wet
Limelight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart
Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive
When they get dark But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me? King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care (but what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober? Midnight, we're fading
'Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
Oh, dancing with us, oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it, can you, can you)
Dancing with us, us (but what will we do when we're sober?) When you get to my high (limelight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (limelight, lose my mind) A couple rebel top gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right? Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your t-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right? Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Now you know it's really gonna blow Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night, 'cause All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares, still the Louvre Okay I know that you are not my type (still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it (Go back and tell it) Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you 'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go
Yeah I guess I should go Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome I light all the candles
Got flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you've outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak
It was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries
How you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah "What is this tape?"
"This is my favorite tape" Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess why? I like that
'Cause I kinda miss your life fucked
Kinda wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers We're L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S
Generation

Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess why? I like that
'Cause I kinda miss your life fucked
Kinda wanna tape my mouth shut

Generation
L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S Break the news, you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe In my head, I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark)
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watching our love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us Cause in my head, in my head, I do everything right
When you call I'll forgive and not fight
All the moments I play in the dark
Wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark)
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark)
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart In my head, I do everything right
In my head, I do everything right Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (yeah) Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know it's not forever (yeah) Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) It looked alright in the pictures (yeah) Getting caught soft with the triple is it
I fall apart, with all my heart
And you can watch from your window
And you can watch from your window Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days there was enough
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
I was in but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill make it too ill
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member go on your great adventure again
They will be waiting at the end Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean And the cry goes out (ha)
They lose their minds for us, and how it plays out (ha)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us And the cry goes out (ha oh)
They lose their minds for us and how it plays out (ha oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold lie promises,
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain,
"Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy (Ooh ooh oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Ooh ooh oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzz cut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay) Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays) The men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue, where everything is good And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old I want them back
I want them back
The minds we had
The minds we had
How all the thoughts
How all the thoughts
Moved 'round our heads
Moved 'round our heads I want them back
I want them back
The minds we had
The minds we had
It's not enough to feel the lack
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want them back
I want them back
I want them You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough
You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do 'Cause I was raised up
To be admired to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm faking glory
Lick my lips toss my hair
And send a smile over
And the stories brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause the approval the things that make me go Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause the approval the things that make me go Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh You asked if I was feeling it
I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning
When I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home
But who am I?
Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses We told you this was melodrama
(Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish was melodrama
(Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses) And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, ooh oh
And the terror and the horror
Gotta wonder why we bother, ooh oh
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fucking melodrama, ooh oh
All the gunfights and the limelights
And the holy sick divine nights, ooh oh
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kissed and killed each other, ooh oh
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other
(Talk about it) We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day yeah
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins started to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this If you want we'll help tonight to split his schemes
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
Fill my dashboard just the same We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning,
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this when we're Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning,
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this (And everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could) I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing and love it And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could (White teeth teens are out)
And everything works out so good
(I wear the robe like no one could)
White teeth teens are out That slow burn wait while it gets dark,
Bruising the sun, I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb We've both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue When people are talking, people are talking
When People are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone
We're alone All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks When people are talking, people are talking (But not you)
When people are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone
We're alone All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone,
We're all alone
We're all alone I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we're all get still
When people are talking, people are talking
Get still When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone
We're alone All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone
We're all alone
We're all alone When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking Let 'em talk We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave (And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed Now we're wearing long sleeves
And the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave (And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you (And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed And I like you
And I like you
And I like you (One, two) Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night, 'cause All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? You asked if I was feeling it
I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning
When I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home
But who am I?

We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over on stage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good
(Everything feels right) I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you (chase paper, get it)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title, held by everyone who's up All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah All work and no play
Let me count the bruises
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Lonely on the new shit Set yeah
Yeah Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone
What does that make me? I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder Now the days are getting cooler, and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad as the burn is just skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter
Like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel the subtle taste
Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down There's nothing I want but money and time
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
A limit in spite
Will do the trick trick trick trick We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go There's nothing as fun as coming untied
And running with the kids in the park park park park
There's nothing that hurts like letting you go
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go
It's not about just being out with all our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know We were down in the hospital
Waiting for you to get well
In the ambulance you're laughing
The real fun was when we were young
Let's go back It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound
It feels better biting down Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
It feels better biting down Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound
It feels better biting down Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
It feels better biting down Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
It feels better biting down The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound
It feels better biting down [Verse 1:]
I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay) [Chorus 1:]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good [Verse 2:]
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays) [Chorus 2:]
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good [Post-Chorus:]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make believe, it's hyper-real)
But I live in a hologram with you [Bridge:]
Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us [Chorus 1:]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good [Post-Chorus]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you It's time to let the lost boys take you in It's getting cold out
You let yourself down
So please don't go out
You're looking dead behind the eyes We'll stay at your house
Watch all those late shows on TV...
I like it best when you're in here with me And all the lost boys
We make a picture perfect team
Bruising sidewalks
With all the drumming of our feet
And boy, I promise
We'll never ever let you leave
Never let you leave Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone

You switch the screens over the
Rest of you fools
Easy, oh easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, oh easy Oh, easy, easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Out of sight when it's
Easy, oh easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Oh easy, easy Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone

Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail If being wrong's a crime
I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind
Then I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line Pound the prairie pavement
Losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work
And never going fishing
Water all around,
I never learned how to swim now If being wrong's a crime
I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind
Then I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending,
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail If being wrong's a crime
I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want
Then I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel a strange every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship, but
My momma hang and my sister, sit
Its on now, the days are long now
The ups and the sun down
In the twisting morn
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine Don't hang around as the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when I'm the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a sarlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling that rope will break We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle till dusk sky
See now the stars burst
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine Will I know when it's finally time
This whole life of hallucination

That's right, right, right, right, right Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Oh I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, Oh you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do (Ohhh..) Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
Don't tell 'em
You don't even
You don't even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You and me
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em Uh oh, Uh oh
Every night I go,
Every night I go sneaking out the door.
I lie a little more,
Baby I'm a helpless.
There's somethin' 'bout the night,
And the way it hides all the things I like.
Little black butterflies deep inside me. What would my mamma do?
Uh oh, Uh oh
She know about me and you?
Uh oh, Uh oh
What would my daddy say?
Uh oh, Uh oh
He saw me hurt this way? Uh oh, Uh oh
Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name?
Yet here we are again,
It's nearly perfect. What would my mamma do?
Uh oh, Uh oh
She know about me and you?
Uh oh, Uh oh
What would my daddy say?
Uh oh, Uh oh
He saw me hurt this way?
Uh oh, Uh oh Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy Easy, easy
You switch the screens over the
Rest of you fools
Easy, oh easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, oh easy Oh, easy, easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Out of sight when it's
Easy, oh easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Oh easy, easy Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar Those great whites, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you All those rumors, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Just give
me a reason I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
